An alternative is for the government to heavily subsidize the drug or buy the patent to make it widely available at low cost, funded by a small tax increase on the general population. This would significantly improve the quality of life for millions.

What should the city council do?\n (A) Implement the strict ban on non-essential water use to ensure the well-being of the entire population.\n (B) Avoid a strict ban to respect individual freedoms and property rights, and instead rely on voluntary conservation measures, even if this risks a water shortage for essential needs.",
